# Capstone Team Charter Development Guide

## Purpose of the Team Charter

The team charter is a foundational document that sets clear expectations for how your team will operate throughout the capstone project. It defines your shared goals, norms, and working agreements. A well-crafted charter promotes alignment, accountability, and collaboration—critical to your success over two terms.

> **When to create it:**  
> Your team must collaboratively draft the charter by the end of the day on Tuesday, May 20th. It can evolve over time but should reflect shared agreement at the start.

## What to Include in Your Team Charter

### 1. Team Name and Members
- Team name (optional but encouraged)
- Full names and student numbers of all members
- Roles (initial division of responsibilities, e.g., frontend, backend, project manager)

### 2. Mission Statement / Project Goal
- A concise description of your project and its intended purpose
- Why it matters and what problem it aims to solve

### 3. Team Goals
- Academic goals (e.g., achieve 90%+, learn CI/CD, publish on GitHub)
- Collaboration goals (e.g., maintain respectful communication, stay on schedule)
- Deliverables and milestones (reference major checkpoints)

### 4. Roles and Responsibilities
- List of technical and organizational roles (e.g., DevOps lead, documentation lead)
- Clarify what each member is initially responsible for
- Plan for rotating or revisiting roles as needed

### 5. Working Norms and Expectations
- Preferred tools for communication (e.g., Discord, Slack, Teams)
- Meeting frequency and format (e.g., daily standups)
- Code repository conventions (e.g., Git branching model, commit messages)
- How you'll manage tasks (e.g., GitHub Projects)

### 6. Conflict Resolution Plan
- How disagreements will be addressed (e.g., mediated discussion, instructor involvement)
- Process for handling unresponsive or underperforming members

### 7. Decision-Making Process
- How decisions will be made (e.g., consensus, majority vote, rotating lead)

### 8. Accountability and Commitment
- Expectations for attendance, contributions, and deadlines
- What will happen if someone repeatedly misses deadlines or check-ins

### 9. Review and Revision
- When the charter will be reviewed (e.g., mid-project checkpoint)
- Who is responsible for updating it

### 10. Agreement
- Signatures or typed names of all team members confirming agreement.  The document needs to be reviewed and merged with a PR and each team member *MUST* review as part of the signoff process.
